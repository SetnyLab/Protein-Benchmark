This directory contains subdirectories with data for proteins: 
chingolin (CH), lambda_repressor (LR), adenylate_kinase (AK), lao_protein (LP), protein_g (PG) and *csv file.

Each subdirectory includes the following files:
1) *gro
structure file (protein + solvent) in GROMACS format,

2) topology.top
GROMACS topology file (protein + solvent); the same file is valid for all conformations of a given protein,

3) *pqr 
protein geometry with partial charges and atomic radii based on Amber force field, in the format used by APBS,

4) *_b.pqr
as above, but with atomic radii taken from the Bondi set,

5) *dx
volumetric data for solvent density distribution around protein structures (number density of water oxygen atoms) obtained based on simulations with TIP3P water model.

The directory includes file:
1) *csv
table 2. with explicit solvent results and their uncertainties in kcal/mol.
More data is available upon request (email: p.setny@cent.uw.edu.pl).
